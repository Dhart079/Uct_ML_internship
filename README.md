# Crop and Weed Detection using YOLOv3 and OpenCV

![](https://github.com/Dhart079/uct_ml_internship/blob/main/Detection/Detection/data/detection/detection_1.jpeg)

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) for crop and weed detection in agricultural fields using Python and OpenCV. YOLO is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system that can detect objects in images and video streams.

## Aim
We aim to develop a system that only sprays pesticides on weed and not on the crop Which will reduce the mixing problem with crops and also reduce the waste of pesticides.

## Problem
Weed is an unwanted thing in agriculture. Weed use the nutrients, water, land and many more things that might have gone to crops. Which results in less production of the required crop. The farmer often uses pesticides to remove weed which is also effective but some pesticides may stick with crop and may causes problems for humans.

## Introduction

Crop and weed detection is a computer vision project aimed at helping farmers identify and differentiate crops from weeds in agricultural fields. This project uses state-of-the-art object detection techniques to assist in precision agriculture, reduce herbicide use, and increase crop yield.

## Features

- Detect and differentiate crops and weeds in images.
- Utilizes YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection.
- Supports various image formats and sources.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.


## Requirements

Before using this project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- OpenCV
- YOLOv3 weights and configuration files (Download from [YOLO website](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/))

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
