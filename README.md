![Crop and Weed Detection](https://github.com/Dhart079/uct_ml_internship/blob/main/Detection/Detection/data/detection/detection_1.jpeg)

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) for crop and weed detection in agricultural fields using Python and OpenCV. YOLO is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system that can detect objects in images and video streams.

## Requirements

Before using this project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- OpenCV
- YOLOv3 weights and configuration files (Download from [YOLO website](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/))

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
